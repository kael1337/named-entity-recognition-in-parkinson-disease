deficit is a common symptom in the patient with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE).', u'Received 12 March 2009 Although presumption has been proposed by the previous study that mTLE may have impaired attention Received in revised form 11 April 2009 networks, no fMRI study has addressed the alteration of the dorsal attention network in mTLE.', u'Twenty- Accepted 20 April 2009 four patients with bilateral mTLE and the same number of gender- and age-matched healthy controls participated in the current fMRI study.', u'Dorsal attention network Functional connectivity in the DAN was then compared between the patients and controls.', u'In addition, Mesial temporal lobe epilepsy the scores of Trail Making Test (TMT) in the patients were correlated to the z-score of the voxels show- FMRI ing significant difference between the two groups.', u'Compared with the controls, the patients with mTLE presented decreased functional connectivity in almost all the regions within the DAN.', u'Moreover, there were negative correlations between the TMT scores and the z-scores in the voxels showing decreased or increased functional connectivity in mTLE.', u'Viewed as a neural network disease, mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) can affect widespread brain functions through the propagation of seizures from epileptogenic zone to the dis- tant brain regions [23].', u'Although the metabolic abnormality within the frontal lobe detected by PET may indicate attention impairments [25], attention network disorder has been presumed to underlie the neuro-pathophysiological mechanism in mTLE [6].', u'With better temporal and spatial resolutions, blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI has been widely used for investigation of epilepsy.', u'However, the previous fMRI studies of mTLE have been limited in the evaluation of memory and language\n\u2217 Corresponding author at: Department of Medical Imaging, Nanjing Jinling Hospital, 305# Eastern Zhongshan Rd., Nanjing 210002, China.', u'Functional connectivity MRI in resting state has emerged as a prevalent technique for studying the brain networks free of specifically designed behavioral tasks.', u'Functional connectivity represents the temporal synchronization of neuronal activities between dis- tant brain regions within a network, and can be used to reflect the normal or abnormal state of specific corresponding functions [8, 14, 16].', u'In addition to the seed region-based cross-correlation analysis, independent component analysis (ICA) is also a commonly used method to map functional connectivity in the brain.', u'The ICA method attempts to determine a set of nonsystematically overlap- ping (spatially independent) brain networks, each with associated time courses.', u'Therefore, ICA-based resting fMRI studies have well defined the dorsal attention network (DAN) besides a few of other brain resting-state networks (RSNs) [3, 11, 20].', u'Specifically, the RSN corresponding to the DAN includes bilaterally the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), cortex at the intersection of precentral and superior frontal sulcus near/at the human frontal eye field (FEF), ventral pre- central (VPG), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG), dedicating to the mediation of goal-directed stimulus-response selection [10, 12].', u'In the present study, we adopted ICA-based functional connectivity MRI to investigate change in the DAN in mTLE.', u'Twenty-four adult patients (25.0 \xb1 5.0 years, 10 females) with bilateral mTLE participated in the study.', u'All the patients underwent a comprehensive clinical evaluation according to the epilepsy classification by the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE).', u'Each patient presented one or more typical symptoms of mTLE, such as abnormal emotional experiences and psychiatric symptoms, epigastric rising, automatisms and dystonic posturing of the limbs.', u'(2) participants were seriously intellectually disabled, and could not perform the following neuropsychological test.', u'All examinations were carried out under the guidance of the Declaration of Helsinki 1975.', u'Written informed consent was obtained from both groups of the participants.', u'The research protocol was approved by the local Medical Ethics Committee in Jinling Hospital and Clinical School of Medical College at Nanjing University.', u'Each patient underwent a Trail Making Test (TMT, including Parts A and B) to assess his/her attention function.', u'Briefly, in Part A, a subject uses a pencil to connect a series of 25 encircled numbers in numerical order.', u'In Part B, a subject connects 25 encircled numbers 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 and letters (A\u2013L) in numerical and alphabetical order, alter- nating between the numbers and letters.', u'All MRI data were collected using a 1.5-T scanner (GE-Signa, Milwaukee, US) in the department of Medical Imaging, Jinling Hospital.', u'The patients had discontinued anti-epilepsy medication for about 24 h prior to the scans according to the requirements for clinical electroencephalogram examinations.', u'The participants were instructed to rest with their eyes closed and keep their heads still during MRI scans.', u'Axial anatomical images were acquired using a T1-FLAIR sequence (TR/TE = 2200 ms/24 ms, matrix = 512 \xd7 512, FOV = 24 cm \xd7 24 cm, slice thickness/gap = 4.0 mm/0.5 mm, 23 slices covered the whole brain) for image registration and functional localization.', u'Functional images were subsequently collected in the same slice orienta- tion with a GRE-EPI sequence (TR/TE = 2000 ms/40 ms, FA = 80 \u25e6 , matrix = 64 \xd7 64, FOV = 24 cm \xd7 24 cm) to measure 200 brain vol- umes, which lasted for a total 400 s.\n The preprocessing of fMRI data was performed using the software package of SPM2 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).', u'The standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template provided by SPM was used for image normalization with a resampling voxel size of 3 mm \xd7 3 mm \xd7 3 mm.', u'After being smoothed with an 8 mm Gaus- sian core (full width half maximum, FWHM), fMRI data were prepared for further ICA processing.', u'ICA was applied to fMRI data of each subject by using the software of Group ICA of fMRI Toolbox (GIFT, Version 1.3b; http://icatb.sourceforge.net/) run on MATLAB 7.', u'Since there is no consensus yet on the selection of an optimal number of independent components (ICs), we chose to have the analysis output 40 ICs (1/5 the number of the time-points in a resting functional scan) according to the empirical index commonly used in the prior studies [15].', u'For each IC, its time course corresponds to the waveform of a specific pattern of coherent brain activity, and the intensity of this pattern of brain activity across the voxels is expressed in the associated spatial map [15, 20].', u'After the ICA separation, a template of the DAN was then used to select respectively the \u201cbest-fit\u201d of the remaining low-frequency components in each subject.', u'Briefly, we used a template-matching procedure by taking the average z-score of voxels falling within the template minus the average z-score of voxels outside the template and selecting the component in which this difference (the goodness-of-fit) was the greatest [15].', u'The standard template of DAN was provided by Dr.\n Mantini (Institute of Advanced Biomedi- cal Technologies, G. D\u2019Annunzio University, Chieti, Italy), which was identical to the RSNs reported in the study by Mantini et al.', u'Subsequently, the z-maps of the DAN were compared between the patient and the control groups using a two-sample t-test.', u'The group comparisons were restricted (masked) to the voxels within each corresponding network as defined by the one-sample t-test of ICA result of the subjects in the control group (p < 0.05 with FDR correction).', u'A statistical map was generated with an integrated threshold at a corrected level of p < 0.001 [with the height threshold of t > 1.72 (p < 0.05, uncorrected) and the extent threshold at a cluster size > 8 voxels (p < 0.001)] [22].', u'The mean z-values within these ROIs were correlated to the TMTs score (only Part B) at the individual level by using a post hoc, Pearson correlation analysis.', u'All participants successfully finished the performance of TMTs.', u'For the Part A (mTLE vs. controls: 42.3 \xb1 9.8 s vs. 27.0 \xb1 4.6 s) and Part B (mTLE vs. controls: 88.9 \xb1 13.4 vs. 73.0 \xb1 7.5 s) of the TMT, there were significant differences of the scores between the patients and the controls (Part A: t = 6.87, p < 0.001; Part B: t = 5.03; p < 0.001).', u'The scores of patients were also summarized in supplementary Table 1.', u'The DANs were extracted successfully from each subject in both the patient and the control groups, based on the goodness- of-fit measurements.', u'The one-sample t-test revealed a typically anatomic pattern of the DAN in both the controls and patients.', u'The network covered bilaterally the IPS, FEF, VPG, and MFG.', u'Moreover, there were notable left-side dominances in the DAN for the controls, but not for the patients (Fig.', u'1 and supplementary Table 2).', u'The two-sample t-tests revealed the differences in functional connectivity within the DAN between the two groups of subjects.', u'1 and Table 1).', u'The behavioral data of the TMT (Part B) scores were negatively correlated to both groups of z-values within the regions showing decreased (r = \u22120.63, p = 0.002) and positive functional connectivity (r = \u22120.56, p = 0.006) (Fig.', u'The DAN revealed by the present study covered the bilateral, IPSs and FEFs, whose anatomic pattern was largely consistent with those mapped with the specific task-induced activation [2] or with the seed region-based functional connectivity [12].', u'The human attention processing can be modeled by two separate neural pathways with functional connectivity [12].', u'The ventral (bottom-up) pathway is right lateralized and composed of the right temporal\u2013parietal junction and the right ventral frontal cortex, and shows activity increases upon detection of salient targets, especially when they appear in unexpected locations.', u'The dorsal system is bilateral and composed of the IPS and the frontal FEF in each hemisphere.', u'It is involved in voluntary (top-down) orienting and shows activity increases after presentation of cues indicating where, when, or to what subjects should direct their attention.', u'The dorsal attention is involved in many higher-order cognitive tasks [10], such as the working memory and executive tasks as well the TMT test used in the present study [7, 21].', u'The RSN extracted by ICA represents a functional network consisting of the regions with coherent low-frequency BOLD fluc- tuations [11, 15].', u'Different from fMRI activations induced by specific stimuli or task [2], these coherent low-frequency BOLD signals detected by resting fMRI reflect the intrinsic nature of the spontaneous neuronal activities, and can be regarded as a sensitive neurobiomarker to depict brain disorders [15, 16].', u'Altered functional connectivities in the network of mesial temporal structures [4], and in the language network have been found in mTLE [29].', u'Our main results concerned the changes in functional connectivity of the DAN in mTLE.', u'This finding could be supported by the negative correlation between the TMT scores and the z-scores within these regions.', u'A previous ERP study has explored the alteration of the P3 in response to different attentional states, and has found that the novelty processing of auditory stimuli is disturbed in the patients with right-sided mTLE [26].', u'Moreover, another ERP study has further demonstrated the dysfunction of ventral attention system in mTLE by showing the reduction in the temporal and frontal sources in visual and auditory oddball paradigms [6].', u'The DAN has been mapped bilaterally by using the seed region- based correlation analysis [12], but the RSN(s) corresponding to the DAN has often been shown pair-wised [3] or left-ward [11, 20] by using ICA.', u'To our knowledge, there was no concern about the lateralization of the DAN in the previous studies.', u'Our results showed the significantly left-ward asymmetric DAN in the controls group since a left-ward template was used [20].', u'In contrast, the left-ward asymmetric pattern was absent in the mTLE patients though the same template was used.', u'In the current study, the z-values in the right FEF were negatively correlated to the TMT scores, i.e.', u'The abnormal TMT scores and the significant correlation between the TMT scores and z-values in DAN confirmed the dorsal attention impairments in mTLE.', u'Although the TMT test is not specifically designed to study the top-down attention processing, the Part B of this popular neuropsychological instrument has been widely used to examine higher-level cognitive processes, such as the visual search, executive control in which the sustained dorsal attention is highly associated [7].', u'Moreover, previous fMRI studies have revealed that the activations in the brain regions of the DAN are in response to the Part B of TMT test, and are left-ward in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and supplementary motor area [21, 30], which is in line with the significant left-ward asymmetry of the DAN as detected in the present study.', u'Since one\u2019s attention function is highly correlated to his/her IQ estimation, it could not be determined if the decreased TMT score of the patient was caused by the decreased IQ, or by the decreased attention function.', u'Therefore, the possible effect of the IQ deficit on the attention function was not considered in the present study, as well in the other studies of mTLE [6, 26].', u'Moreover, the DAN is often detected inconsis- tently in different studies [3, 11, 20].', u'However, in the present study, the template used in the \u201cbest-fit\u201d procedure was obtained from the result of a published work [20].', u'Third, although the altered DAN may reflect the functional changes in their corresponding networks, future study using a specific task, for example the TMT paradigm may reveal the attention impairment in a more direct way in patients with mTLE.', u'Based on the observation of the RSN detected by ICA, we explored the altered DAN in the patients with mTLE.', u'Our findings provide neuroimaging evidences of the neuro-pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the attention impairments in mTLE.', u'(A) Results of the one-sample t-test of the DAN in the mTLE patients.', u'(B) Results of the one-sample t-test of the DAN in the controls.', u'(C) Group
