[u'DTI Correlates of Distinct Cognitive Impairments in Parkinson\u2019s Disease\nAbstract: The spectrum of cognitive symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) can span various domains, including executive function, language, attention, memory, and visuospatial skills.', u'These symptoms may be attributable to the degradation of projection fibers associated with the underlying neurodegenerative process.', u'Lastly, memory impairment mainly involved MD alterations within the fornix.', u'No significant correlations were found between visuospatial skills and DTI measures.', u'DTI combined with neurocognitive tests may be a valuable biomarker for identifying cognitive impairments in PD.', u'Hum Brain Mapp 35:1325\u20131333, 2014.', u'V C 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.\n Key

domains, including frontal/executive function, memory, visuospatial skills, attention, and language [ McKinlay et al., 2009; Zgaljardic et al., 2003].', u'Despite its prevalence and impact, the spectrum of impairment and neural basis of cognitive impairments in PD are not fully characterized.', u'The heterogeneity is likely attributable to distinct patterns and combinations of neurochemical degeneration (e.g., dopaminergic nigro- striatal degeneration vs. cholinergic degeneration (e.g., basal nucleus of Meynert [Gaspar and Gray, 1984])) and unique anatomic patterns of Lewy body deposition (in contrast to the uniform progression of synucleinopathies suggested by Braak et al.', u'While frontal executive impairments are likely dopaminergically mediated, varying with a common functional polymorphism in the cate- chol-O-methyltransferase gene (COMT Val 158 Met) which modulates prefrontal dopamine availability [Foltynie et al., 2004b; Williams-Gray et al., 2009], temporal lobe mediated impairments are more likely related to cholinergic impairments and more extensive subcortical and neocortical Lewy body deposition [Emre, 2003; Gaspar and Gray, 1984; Goris et al., 2007; Mattila et al., 2000; Williams-Gray et al., 2009].', u'Demonstration of the anatomic basis and sep- arability of these distinct patterns of cognitive impairment would greatly enhance our understanding of these processes, facilitate anatomically driven investigations of the neurobiological processes underlying these impairments, and impact the clinical management of patients with PD.', u'Several studies have confirmed the relationship between white matter changes and the motor manifestations of PD [Bohnen and Albin, 2011; Yoshikawa et al., 2004; Zhan et al., 2012].', u'However, the neuroanatomical basis and topography of the neurobiological processes that account for these cognitive impairments have not been well characterized due to limitations in prior neuroimaging analyses and the use of coarse, incomplete, and inadequate neurocognitive assessments, like the mini-mental status examination (MMSE) in Parkinson\u2019s patients [Gattellaro et al., 2009; Hattori et al., 2012].', u'Studies have shown that tools that are not specific for PD (e.g., MMSE and SF-36) have poor accuracy and reliability in diagnosing cognitive impairment, dementia, and quality-of-life (QOL) in PD [Brown et al., 2009; Kulisevsky and Pagonabarraga, 2009].', u'DTI parameters, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), can be used to infer neural sub- strates underlying specific cognitive functions when correlated with neuropsychological performance [Sasson et al., 2012].', u'In this study, we used DTI to evaluate the relationship between measures of white matter integrity in prede- fined regions-of-interest (ROIs) and performance in five distinct cognitive domains (executive function, language, attention, memory, and visuospatial skills) in 16 patients with PD with varying degrees of cognitive impairment, as detailed using comprehensive neuropsychological testing.', u'A post hoc voxel-based analysis was supplemented to con- firm the ROI-based results.', u'We tested two hypotheses: (1) Impairments in different cognitive domains are associated with changes in white matter integrity in distinct cerebral networks.', u'Sixteen patients (11 males, 5 females, average age 62.2 \xc6 9.6 years) who had undergone evaluation for stereotactic implantation of deep brain stimulators for PD were included in this retrospective study.', u'All patients were from UCLA\u2019s stereotactic neurosurgery database through August 2011 and had detailed preoperative neuropsychological testing results and MRI data.', u'Patients\u2019 Hoehn and Yahr clinical staging while on medication had a mean of 2.3 \xc6 0.9 with mean disease duration of 9.5 \xc6 6.0 years.', u'All studies and analysis were done after obtaining ap- proval from and in accordance with guidelines provided by the UCLA Institutional Review Board.', u'Due to the inhomogeneity of the neurocognitive tests used to evaluate each domain in this clinical dataset and in order to reduce the feature set analyzed, we derived a single score for each patient in each cognitive domain based on a pre-selected list of domain-representa- tive tests.', u'Each patient\u2019s detailed neuropsychological testing result was carefully and independently reviewed by two independent evaluators, who calculated an average percentile score for each domain for each subject using the age-matched percentile scores from the domain-representa- tive tests.', u'In cases with more than a 5 percentile discrepancy, a third evaluator provided  Lower percentile scores indicate more impairment.', u'WMS-IV 1\u20444 Wechsler Memory Scale, Fourth Edition; CVLT 1\u20444 California Verbal Learning Test; NAB 1\u20444 Neuropsychological Assessment Battery; VOT 1\u20444 Visual

percentile performance scores in each cognitive domain are reported in Table I, ranging between 39.48 and 48.56.', u'There were no significant correlations between age and either neurocognitive scores in each domain or FA and MD values in the 40 ROI evaluated (85 comparisons), with the exception of MD values within the right hippocampus and age (P 1\u20444 0.0083).', u'No significant correlations were observed between neurocognitive scores and disease severity measures.', u'Significant ROI correlations (P < 0.01) between the neurocognitive domain scores and DTI parameters were identified in every cognitive domain except for the visuospatial domain (Table III).', u'A graphical representation of the significant interactions is presented in Figures 2 and 3.', u'Overall, MD values were more often correlated with scores in each domain than FA values (Table III).', u'The post hoc voxel- based analysis (accounting for multiple comparisons) verified the findings of the ROI-based approach with few exceptions (detailed in Table III).', u'Figure 3.', u'Regression analyses between DTI indices and measures of cognitive performance.', u'Although a number of DTI studies have been conducted to better understand PD pathology, only a few have focused on the cognitive correlates of the disease and mostly relied on the use of MMSE as a cognitive assessment instrument [Hattori et al., 2012], our study is the first to demonstrate a comprehensive approach to studying the broad range of cognitive deficits in PD by using DTI coupled with domain specific neurocognitive tests.', u'While previously recognized in the neuropsychological literature [Kantarci et al., 2011; Sasson et al., 2012], this study confirms that, despite some overlap, impairments in distinct cognitive domains are subserved by different white matter networks.', u'Cognitive impairments related to impairments in frontal lobe function appear to be the most prominent and typically occur early in the disease stage [Bruck et al., 2004; Farina et al., 2000; Lees and Smith, 1983; Taylor et al., 1986].', u'Executive function, generally referring to higher cognitive tasks involving planning, initiating, and monitoring goal- directed behavior [ McKinlay et al., 2010], is often regarded as the most common and profound cognitive deficit in patients with PD [Lewis et al., 2003; Zgaljardic et al., 2003].', u'Our results, from both FA and MD measures, revealed that executive dysfunction in PD was largely, yet not exclu- sively, associated with changes in DTI signal characteristics in frontal projection fibers, including the ACR, ALIC (connections between the frontal cortex, striatum, and thalamus), genu of corpus callosum (prefrontal connections between the two hemispheres), SFO (connections between frontal lobe and parietal lobe), and the sagittal stratum, which includes the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus.', u'From recent DTI studies, parietal lobe associations in particular have been shown to involve executive functioning.', u'Unlike executive function, significant correlations between attention and surrogate measures of microstructural integrity were found to be more widespread throughout the brain, engaging the most number of white matter tracts compared to the other domains.', u'The widespread associations likely are in part attributable to the distrib- uted nature of attentional networks, which include alert- ing, orienting, and executive attention components [Posner and Rothbart, 2007].', u'Although diffuse correlations were identified, the most significant associations with the attention domain were found in the left cingulate gyrus (cingulum) (P < 0.001) and splenium (P 1\u20444 0.001).', u'Diffusion abnormalities have previously been reported in the cingulum in patients with PD [Gattellaro et al., 2009; Kamagata et al., 2012; Karagulle Kendi et al., 2008].', u'Nonverbal memory impairment was associated with MD alterations in the fornix (short-term) and the right ACR (long-term).', u'Our finding is in agreement with the current literature investigating the role of the fornix in memory [D\u2019Esposito et al., 1995; Mielke et al., 2012; Thomas et al., 2011; Zhuang et al., 2012].', u'Finally, the results of the language domain revealed all frontal connecting white matter regions and considerably overlapped with the executive cognitive domain.', u'One possible explanation for such overlap could be attributed to some of the similar neurocognitive tests used to assess the two domains.', u'Measures of verbal fluency including letter fluency and category/animal fluency were used in both domains.', u'FA and MD are thought to reflect different tissue characteristics, with FA sensitive to tissue directionality and organization, and MD to tissue den- sity [Farina et al., 2000; Wiltshire et al., 2010].', u'Finally, although we hypothesized and largely observed that distinct cognitive domains are supported by different brain networks, we found the MD in the right ACR to be consistently related to performance in multiple domains (except the visuospatial domain).', u'Specifi- cally, we hypothesize that the association of ACR with motor performance may have adversely affected performance across multiple domains, independent of true function in each domain.', u'This highlights the possibility that standardized tests designed in otherwise normal patient populations may not be directly applicable to diseased populations and may require cautious and expert interpretation by trained neuropsychologists.', u'The PD- Cognitive Rating Scale (PD-CRS), for example, provides the best combination of acceptability, internal consistency, and test-retest and inter-rater reliability and includes assessments of both frontal-subcortical and instrumental-cortical function [Pagonabarraga et al., 2008].', u'While the atlas-based  approach employed here does not account for all inter- subject anatomic variability, the white matter atlas used is a reliable and validated atlas and the described methodol- ogy is well accepted.', u'Given the underlying hypothesis that there are changes in FA and MD associated with changes in distinct neurocognitive domains, one could not assume that equiv- alent and comparable MR-tractography could be performed in differentially affected subjects and tracts.', u'Perhaps the most significant shortcoming of the current cross-sectional analysis relates to limitations of sample size.', u'A prospective longitudinal study with age-matched controls and a standardized neurocognitive battery that is specific for PD would be needed to enable us to better assess the timing of neuroanatomical changes relative to cognitive impairments and to validate whether the putative biomarkers could be used for early detection.', u'This mapping of subcortical networks may provide insight into the etiology of cognitive impairment in PD as well as provide guidance for future studies to identify early imaging biomarkers of cognitive impairment.', u'Authors acknowledge Dr.\n Antonio DeSalles for sharing his clinical database for evaluation for this study
