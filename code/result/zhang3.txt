magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have revealed large-scale functional networks in the human brain.', u'1 Data used in preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.ucla.edu).', u'As such, the investigators within the ADNI contributed to the design and implementation of ADNI and/or provided data but did not participate in analysis or writing of this report.', u'A complete listing of ADNI investigators can be found at http://adni.loni.ucla.', u'http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neurobiolaging.2016.04.018\n\n        \n      \nresting-state FC can be considered a measure of basic activity of intrinsic functional networks in the brain ( Smith et al., 2009).', u'In Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), altered FC in resting-state networks has been reported across the spectrum of clinical severity including elderly cognitively normal subjects with increased levels of amyloid burden, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and dementia (Greicius et al., 2004; Hedden et al., 2009; Sorg et al., 2007).', u'Such abnormalities of FC were detected in AD even when controlling for gray matter atrophy (Agosta et al., 2012; Sorg et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2013).', u'The rationale for using resting-state FC as a predictor of memory performance comes from the known spatial overlap between resting-state networks and task-related networks for cognitive functions (Li et al., 2015; Smith et al., 2009; Yeo et al., 2011).', u'A reduction of FC within the DMN has been observed in preclinical AD, aMCI, and dementia (Greicius et al., 2004; Hedden et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2013) and was found to be associated with lower episodic memory performance (Wang et al., 2013).', u'However, several studies failed to reveal an association between FC in the DMN and memory impairment in AD or aMCI (Agosta et al., 2012; Binnewijzend et al., 2012).', u'To understand which resting-state FC changes are related to episodic memory performance, brain regions other than the DMN need to be taken into account.', u'Areas commonly activated during memory encoding or retrieval are distributed across several of the \u201cclassic\u201d resting-state networks (Li et al., 2015), suggesting that brain activity underlying episodic memory is not confined to any single network (Damoiseaux et al., 2006).', u'For example, a recent resting-state fMRI study showed that resting-state FC between different resting-state networks such as the DMN, cingular- opercular network, and the frontoparietal attention network was associated with memory performance in cognitively healthy subjects (Geerligs et al., 2015).', u'In the present study, we mapped the number of connections and the strength of resting-state FC between meta-analytically determined hotspots of brain activation observed during successful memory retrieval (Spaniol et al., 2009).', u'The aims of the present study were to test whether FC between these core brain regions (1) can be observed during rest, (2) is altered in aMCI and AD, and (3) is predictive of episodic memory impairment as assessed by standard neuropsychological tests.', u'All subjects were recruited within the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, phase GO and II, www.loni.ucla.', u'For the present study, we included a total of 23 elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC), 76 subjects with aMCI and 19 AD.', u'HC subjects were required to show low global levels of AV45-PET binding (stan- dardized uptake value ratio <1.11, A b \xc0) to yield a control group with low probability of AD pathology.', u'In ADNI, the general inclusion criteria were: age between 50 and 90 years, modified Hachinski score 4, education of at least 6 grade level, and stable treatment of at least 4 weeks in case of treatment with permitted medication.', u'ADNI is a longitudinal multicenter study started in 2003 in North America as a public private partnership to investigate neuropsychological parameters, neuroimaging features, and other biomarker for tracking and predicting AD-related cerebral and cognitive changes (see Supplementary Method).', u'Ethical approval was obtained by the ADNI investigators (http://www.adni-info.', u'This study was approved by the institutional review boards of all the participating institutions.', u'Episodic memory ability was quantified by a composite score (ADNI-memory) based on subcomponents of common neuropsychological tests including the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (word list learning trials, recall, and recognition), Mini-Mental State Examination (word recall), Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS, word list learning, recall, and recognition) and Logical Memory I and II, as previously described (Crane et al., 2012).', u'The composite scores were downloaded from the ADNI web page (http://adni.loniucla.edu/).', u'All MRI data were acquired on 3T Philips systems.', u'For rsfMRI, subjects were instructed to keep their eyes open, the following acquisition parameters were used: single shot T2*-weighted echo planer imaging pulse sequence in transverse slice orientation, with repetition time/echo time 1\u20444 3000/30 ms, flip angle 1\u20444 80 , 3.3 mm isotropic spatial resolution with 48 slices, with voxel size of 3.31 \xc2 3.31 \xc2 3.31, matrix size of 64 \xc2 59, and 140 volumes (for more detail refer to the MRI Training Manual, http://adni.loni.usc.edu/).', u'The realigned volumes were registered to the subject\u2019s T1-weighted MRI image and high-dimensionally normalized to MNI standard space (see Supplementary Method).', u'The images were smoothed (full width at half maximum 6 mm), detrended, and band-pass filtered between 0.01 and 0.08 Hz (see also Supplementary Method for more details).', u'MRI acquisition\n2.4. fMRI preprocessing\nWe computed the FC between regions of interest (ROI) of the putative episodic memory network.', u'ROIs were placed according to a previously published voxelwise activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 30 published fMRI studies on episodic memory, including 478 cognitively healthy adults (Spaniol et al., 2009).', u'The meta-analysis yielded 18 peak coordinates of brain activation associated with successful memory retrieval on forced choice recognition tasks (Spaniol et al., 2009).', u'The spatial coordinates were converted from Tailarach space to the MNI standard space using the Lancaster transform (Lancaster et al., 2007).', u'The MNI coordinates of each ROI are listed in Supplementary Table 1 and the location in the brain is displayed in Supplementary Fig.', u'To assess whether partial volume effects may influence the results, we also obtained GM volume within the ROIs.', u'ROI GM volume was estimated based on the spatially normalized and modulated gray matter maps, where the same spatial normalization parameters were used that had also been applied to the resting-state fMRI scans for spatial normalization to the MNI space.', u'The ROI-to-ROI FC analysis was performed with the Conn toolbox v.\n 13.p based on MATLAB (http://www.nitrc.org/projects/ conn; Whitfield-Gabrieli and Nieto-Castanon, 2012).', u'The strength of FC was determined via pairwise Pearson-moment correlations between the mean time courses of the ROIs, resulting in a 18 \xc2 18 matrix of FC values which were Fisher z-score transformed.', u'To test the number of significant connections between the ROIs in each group, we computed one-sample t tests for each pairwise ROI- to-ROI FC value within each group (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected at p 1\u20444 0.05, n 1\u20444 153).', u'Differences in the number of significant connections between groups were computed via 2-sample t tests.', u'To select potential predictors of episodic memory performance among the high number of ROI-to-ROI values, we applied the following 2-step procedure.', u'In the first step, we tested for which ROI-to-ROI connections the strength of FC was abnormally changed in AD dementia subjects compared to HC subjects.', u'The p-value for each ANCOVA was FDR-corrected at p < 0.05 (for n 1\u20444 153 multiple comparisons).', u'In the second step, the strength of FC of those ROI-to-ROI connections that were found significantly altered in the AD dementia group was tested as predictors of episodic memory performance in the aMCI group.', u'We computed linear regression models including episodic memory score as the dependent variable and strength of FC, age, gender, education, and MMSE as independent variables.', u'For exploratory reasons, we compared the strength of FC values among all groups including HC, aMCI, and AD.', u'Simple main effects of diagnosis were followed up by Fisher\u2019s least significance difference post hoc test for pairwise group comparisons, FDR-corrected at p 1\u20444 0.05.', u'All group-level statistical analyses were done with the stats package of statistical software R implemented in R Studio v.\n 0.98.501 (Boston, MA, http://www.rstudio.com/).', u'Neuropsychological and demographic summary statistics for each diagnostic group are provided in Table 1.',

Wang et al., 2007).', u'In contrast, reduced resting-state FC in patients with MCI and AD was primarily confined to the DMN in previous studies (Agosta et al., 2012; Binnewijzend et al., 2012; Greicius et al., 2004).', u'For the present study, the increase in the strength of FC was found exclusively for connections that were not confined to the DMN but spanned different functional clusters, that is, the connections were between the frontoparietal network (MFG ROI) and the posterior DMN (AG ROI), medial temporal lobe subsystem (parahippocampus), or a subcortical cluster (thalamus).', u'The second major finding showed that an abnormal increase in the strength of FC was associated with reduced episodic memory performance in aMCI.', u'In cognitively normal subjects, higher levels of interhemispheric FC between the hippocampi were associated with increased higher age and associated with faster memory decline (Salami et al., 2014).', u'Here, we extended these findings by showing that the increased strength of FC between the hippocampus and lateral frontal cortex is associated with memory decline in aMCI.', u'Together, these results suggest that hippocampus hyperactivity and the hyperconnectivity to brain areas involved in memory-related brain activation is detrimental to episodic memory performance in aMCI.', u'Results of a recent meta-analysis of resting-state fMRI studies suggested increased FC in brain areas such as the subcortical structures and the medial temporal and parietal lobe that occurred early in the course of AD (Jacobs et al., 2013).', u'Increased activation of medial temporal lobe and parietal brain regions has also been observed in relation to memory task-fMRI, when tested in the preclinical and prodromal stage of AD (Celone et al., 2006; Sperling, et al., 2009, 2010).', u'The question arises whether increased resting- state fMRI connectivity within the medial temporal lobe and other brain regions may constitute a candidate biomarker for the early detection of AD-related brain abnormalities (Jacobs et al., 2013).', u'Compared to task-fMRI, resting-state fMRI is due to its task-free and relatively short assessment attractive for clinical application.', u'Few studies, however, have tested resting-state fMRI for the detection of MCI or AD dementia (Bai et al., 2011; Dyrba et al., 2015; Wee et al., 2012), where resting-state fMRI connectivity measures alone stayed below a clinically relevant classification accuracy below 85%.', u'One possible explanation is that increased brain activation results from increased deposition of A b .', u'Previous studies showed that increased brain activity during memory task was associated with A b deposition in elderly cognitively healthy subjects (Elman et al., 2014) and aMCI patients (Huijbers et al., 2015).', u'Results obtained in mice suggest that levels of A b are associated with epileptic spikes in neural activity, which may potentially explain increased neural activity in patients with AD.', u'If A b leads to aberrant neural activity, FC may not be increased, since FC requires the coordinated activity between different brain areas rather than a local increase in brain activity.', u'In the present study, we did not find the observed increase in FC to be dependent on A b when tested in the aMCI subjects.', u'According to the dedifferentiation hypothesis, age-related changes in brain function lead to more diffuse brain activity due to less efficient neural processing (Dennis and Cabeza, 2011).', u'Consistent with the dedifferentiation hypothesis, a study in elderly cognitively healthy subjects found an age-related decrease in modularity of resting-state FC within networks and increased inter-network connectivity (Geerligs et al., 2015).', u'In the present study, we found not only increased strength of FC but also a higher number of connections in MCI and AD compared to HC.', u'The number of connections peaked in MCI, being significantly higher compared to AD.', u'Less efficient neural processing may require increased FC, that is, a compensatory recruitment of additional neural resources to maintain task performance (Dickerson et al., 2004; Grady et al., 2003).', u'Thus, the current finding of an inverse association between increased FC and memory performance may reflect a failed compensatory attempt (Bakker et al., 2012; Pasquini et al., 2014).', u'Increased levels of FC during resting-state FC provide only a snapshot of brain activity.', u'To alleviate this drawback, we attempted to tailor the study in a hypothesis-driven way, focusing on meta-analysisederived brain regions that have previously been found to be activated during memory retrieval processes.', u'However, a combined resting-state and memory taskerelated fMRI study design (Koch et al., 2014) is encouraged for future studies to investigate the association between rsfMRI and memory performance.', u'The research was funded by grants of the LMU Excellent Initiative and the European Commission (ERC, PCIG12-GA-2012-334259 to Michael Ewers), Alzheimer\u2019s Forschung Initiative (AFI) and FP6  ERA-NET NEURON (01 EW1207 to Martin Dichgans), and China Scholarship Council (to Yifei Zhang).', u'Resting state fMRI in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: beyond the default mode network.', u'Toward discovery science of human brain function.', u'Develop- ment and assessment of a composite score for memory in the Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI).', u'Brain Imaging Behav.', u'Age-related dedifferentiation of learning systems: an fMRI study of implicit and explicit learning.', u'Multimodal analysis of functional and structural disconnection in Alzheimer\u2019s disease using multiple kernel SVM.', u'Evidence from functional neuroimaging of a compensatory prefrontal network in Alzheimer\u2019s disease.', u'Default-mode network activity distinguishes Alzheimer\u2019s disease from healthy aging: evidence from functional MRI.', u'Disruption of functional connectivity in clinically normal older adults harboring amyloid burden.', u'Amyloid-beta deposition in mild cognitive impairment is associated with increased hippocampal activity, atrophy and clinical progression.', u'Meta-analysis of functional network alterations in Alzheimer\u2019s disease: toward a network biomarker.', u'Bias between MNI and Talairach coordinates analyzed using the ICBM-152 brain template.', u'Hippocampal activation in adults with mild cognitive impairment predicts subsequent cognitive decline.', u'Link between hippocampus\u2019 raised local and eased global intrinsic connectivity in AD.', u'Correspondence of the\n          brain\u2019s functional architecture during activation and rest.', u'Selective changes of resting-state networks in individuals at risk for Alzheimer\u2019s disease.', u'Event- related fMRI studies of episodic encoding and retrieval: meta-analyses using activation likelihood estimation.', u'Functional alterations in memory networks in early Alzheimer\u2019s disease.', u'Changes in hippocampal connectivity in the early stages of Alzheimer\u2019s disease: evidence from resting state fMRI.', u'Identification of MCI individuals using structural and functional connectivity networks.', u'The Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative: a review of papers published since its incep- tion.', u'Conn: a functional connectivity toolbox for correlated and anticorrelated brain networks.', u'The organization of the human cerebral cortex estimated by intrinsic functional connectivity.', u'/ Neurobiology of Aging 45 (2016) 43e49\n        49\n      \n']
