Dos et al., 2011; Leube et al., 2008; Sarazin et al., 2010; Schmidt- Wilcke et al., 2009).', u'As a fully automated, rater-independent, easily applicable volume measure- ment across the entire brain, the VBM method is less affected by the subjective factors of researchers and participants compared with fMRI.', u'When interpreting the results of a VBM study, it is necessary to refer to the findings of studies using other functional techniques to ensure a comprehensive and complementary analysis.', u'Our study showed again that the overall EF and its core components were significantly impaired in patients with aMCI, which is consistent with the results reported in some recent studies (Brandt et al., 2009; Johns et al., 2012; Liu-Ambrose et al., 2008; Marshall et al., 2011; Saunders and Summers, 2011; Zheng et al., 2012a).', u'The multiple regression analyses of our study showed that the atrophic brain regions associated with the decline of the core EF components in patients with aMCI were mainly distributed in the PFC and temporal cortex.', u'Interestingly, different core EF components exhibit distinct patterns of distribution of the related brain regions within the PFC.', u'The brain region related to response inhibition was located in the right inferior PFC (inferior frontal gyrus), although brain regions related to working memory and task shifting were distributed in the bilateral PFC (Additional brain areas, particularly the PFC, were found to be related to deficient performances in EF tasks if the multiple regression analyses were not restricted to significant group differences; Supplementary Fig.', u'These findings of the neural correlates of EF in the aMCI group using VBM analyses are consistent with the results obtained from previous EF studies using other methods such as fMRI in normal persons or in patients with other neurologic disease (Aron and Poldrack, 2006; Aron et al., 2003, 2004; Duann et al., 2009; Lenartowicz and McIntosh, 2005; Osaka et al., 2007; Owen et al., 2005; Pa et al., 2010).', u'found that only the volume of the lesion in rIFG (in particular, the pars triangularis, BA 45) was correlated with response inhibition (Aron et al., 2003).', u'These 2 studies, which used different morphometric methods (ROI and VBM) in patients with different diseases, arrived at the same conclusion, which highly supports the rIFG as a key locus in the neural network of response inhibition.', u'Activation of the anterior cingulate cortex was frequently observed in fMRI studies of EF, including working memory (Lenartowicz and McIntosh, 2005; Osaka et al., 2007).', u'It is thought that in a neural network of EF, the ACC signals to the dorsolateral PFC via strong interconnections when higher-level modulation of lower-level processes is required (Gilbert and Burgess, 2008).', u'The premotor cortex is thought to maintain visuospatial attention during working memory, and the inferior frontal gyrus is involved in working memory when participants plan to remember or recall.', u'The involvement of the bilateral PFC in task switching, as shown in the present study, is consistent with several previous studies (Aron et al., 2004; Pa et al., 2010).', u'(Pa et al., 2010), a correlation between set-shifting performance and GM volume was investigated in 160 participants with neurodegenerative disease or MCI, as well as in healthy older adults.', u'showed that the 2 components involved in the task-switching process (inhibition of task-sets and topedown control of the task-set) were controlled by brain regions in the right and left PFC, respectively (Aron et al., 2004).', u'However, the functional roles of the different parts of the PFC in task switching remain unclear.', u'In addition, another interesting finding of this study was that atrophy of the temporal lobes in patients with aMCI was correlated with a decline in the 3 core EF components, particularly the more- odd shifting task.', u'For example, in a study conducted by Karlsgodt et al., the temporal lobe, particularly the MTLs, participates in working memory when the brain is storing unfamiliar or new information (Karlsgodt et al., 2005).', u'Because the PFC has strong reciprocal connections with various cortical areas, including the temporal cortex, and brain atrophy in aMCI is most significant in the temporal lobes, it is possible that the pathologic changes in the temporal lobes impair the anatomic and functional connections between the PFC and temporal cortex, which may in turn affect the efficacy of the PFC in EF tasks.', u'In a study conducted by Kucukboyaci et al., significant correlations between frontotemporal fiber tract integrity and task- switching performance were found in healthy participants (Kucukboyaci et al., 2012).', u'Using less stringent statistical standards, this study showed that the gray matter volume in the right inferior frontal gyrus was associated with 3 core EF components, suggesting that the rIFG is a core neuroanatomic correlate of the EF.', u'Moreover, in an fMRI study conducted by McNab et al., the rIFG was a common region activated by 3 response inhibition tasks and 2 working memory tasks (McNab et al., 2008), suggesting that the rIFG is a common neural component of the inhibitory and working memory systems.', u'However, some recent studies have shown that clinically diagnosed single-domain patients with aMCI exhibited significant EF deficits when they performed detailed EF evaluations that were not included in the routine clinical neuropsychological assessment (Johns et al., 2012).', u'In our previous neuropsychological study, all of the patients with aMCI showed deficits in the core EF components, including those who obtained full scores in the EF tasks that are frequently used in clinical practice (Zheng et al., 2012a).', u'Single- and multiple-domain patients with aMCI share a common pattern of GM atrophy that differs only in severity (Brambati et al., 2009).', u'Thus, in the present study, which examined only the neural correlates of EF deficits in patients with aMCI, we did not classify the patients with aMCI into single- and multiple- domain subtypes.', u'First, we used a relatively small number of patients with aMCI and age- and sex-matched control participants.', u'Second, we did not include fMRI data in this study to elucidate the role of brain regions that were associated with EF by VBM analysis.', u'Structural and fMRI studies performed in the same group of participants would provide more convincing evidence.', u'In summary, we found that the impairments of 3 core EF components in patients with aMCI were correlated with regional atrophy of the temporal and prefrontal cortices.', u'Taken together, our brain morphologic data contribute to a better understanding of the role of these brain areas in the neural network of executive functioning.', u'Slice positions are indicated in the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates.', u'T value is indexed by the colourbar.', u'Table 4 Atrophic brain regions related to the decline of the 3 core EF components in patients with aMCI\n          \n             EF task Anatomical structure Volume (mm 3 ) MNI coordinates t x y z\n            \n              \n                \n                   Stop-signal task\n                   1.', u'R superior temporal gyrus (BA 38)\n                   37\n                   39\n                   14\n                   \xc020\n                   5.62\n                \n                \n                   Keep track task\n                   1.', u'R middle temporal gyrus (BA 21)\n                   581\n                   68\n                   \xc034\n                   \xc08\n                   5.09\n                \n                \n                   More-odd shifting task\n                   1.', u'L middle frontal gyrus (BA 8)\n                   37\n                   \xc042\n                   27\n                   47\n                   5.23\n                \n                \n                  \n                   2.', u'Key: aMCI, amnestic mild\n                   cognitive impairment;
