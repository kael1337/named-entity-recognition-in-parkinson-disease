(2) digit span forward and backward from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised7; (3) letter fluency (the letter A from the FAS test8; and (4) Animal category fluency.', u'8 The Executive scale used letter fluency (F, A, and S), digit span backward, visual span backward, and the Initiation-Perseveration subscale of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale as donor scales.', u'Hippocampal volumes were determined using commercially available software (Medtronic Surgical Navigation Technologies, Louisville, CO).', u'10 Although MRI volumes were determined for each hippocampus, only data from the same cerebral hemisphere in which counts were performed were used in this analysis.', u'11 Beginning at the level of the pes, the entire hippocampus from one hemisphere, comprising five to seven slices, was blocked for stereology.', u'An entire hippocampus was obtained from 28 cases (13 female and 15 male cases; Table 1).', u'From each 5mm-thick slab, 50\u03bcm-thick sections were cut on a freezing microtome, mounted on glass slides, and stained overnight in gallocyanine.', u'The remainder of each slab was embedded in paraffin and used for routine assessment of AD and vascular pathology.', u'Cases were evaluated for neurofibrillary tangle load (Braak score),12 neuritic plaque burden (Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease [CERAD] rating),13 vascular lesions including infarcts (cerebrovascular disease [CVD] score),14 Lewy bodies (McKeith Lewy body score),15 and Vonsattel rating of cerebral amyloid angiopathy16 (CAA), expanded to grade IV where there is evidence of CAA-associated microangiopathy.', u'Hippocampal sclerosis (HS) was given a score of 0 when there was no HS, 1 when the segmental neuron loss was limited to a single CA segment, 2 when the HS extended from CA1 to the prosubiculum, and 3 when the HS involved the entire pyramidal layer or affected two or more sectors of the hippocampus.', u'The severity of cerebrovascular ischemic brain injury was rated using a new CVD-pathology scoring system developed within this project.', u'14 The CVD-pathology score (0 \u2013 60 points) reflects the number and location of cystic infarcts, lacunar infarcts, and microinfarcts in the hippocampus and several gray and white matter regions.', u'The HS score was included in the CVD-pathology score but acute infarcts were not.', u'We used Braak and Braak staging to confirm the diagnosis of AD, AD being defined by a Braak stage higher than IV.', u'There are no consensus criteria for the pathological diagnosis of IVD.', u'We arbitrarily used CVD-pathology score of 4 or greater for a working diagnosis of IVD.', u'belief that there was sufficient cerebrovascular pathology to account for dementia in a given patient.', u'One gallocyanine-stained section was systematically chosen from each slab, and the CA1 and CA2 regions were identified and outlined on the coverslip using waterproof markers.', u'17 The slide was placed on the microscope stage in a random orientation and overlaid with a uniform grid.', u'Counts were performed using an SPLAN 100X oil-immersion objective (N.A.', u'= 1.25) on a Nikon Microphot FX microscope fitted with a Mertzhauser XYZ-stage and driven by StereoInvestigator (MicroBrightfield, Williston, VT) image analysis system.', u'The stage was programmed to move in a buxtrophedral pattern with stage steps ranging from 250 to 1,000\u03bcm in each direction.', u'A stage micrometer was used to calibrate the stage step and the counting frame.', u'The counting frame for the dissector was a 30 \xd7 30\u03bcm square.', u'The starting plane was 1 to 5\u03bcm below the surface of the section to avoid cutting artifacts and surface irregularities.', u'The height of the fractionator volume was 12\u03bcm.', u'Neuron size was measured with the nucleolator component of StereoInvestigator using a minimum of five rays.', u'Each neuron not excluded by the above criteria was measured by the operator.', u'The estimated volume (in cubic micrometers) was determined by StereoInvestigator.', u'The sampling scheme and counting protocol described above results in a counting accuracy with a coefficient of error for the estimate of the number of neurons (N), calculated as follows:\nCE(\u03a3Q\u2212) = (VAR(N) \u03a3Q\u2212 where CE = coefficient of error;

three cases scored Possible AD because of a lower prevalence of cortical neuritic plaques.', u'The McKeith score for all cases was 0 because no Lewy bodies were seen in the cortex or sub-stantia nigra using hematoxylin and eosin, ubiquitin, or \u03b1-synuclein immunostains.', u'Infarct size ranged from 8mm 3 to 30cm 3 .', u'Many of these had been noted by the radiologist on the premortem MRI, although others occurred in the interval between MRI and death.', u'Moderate to severe white matter pallor was observed in eight cases.', u'Nine cases had Vonsattel grade I or II CAA, whereas six cases had Vonsattel grade III or IV CAA.', u'Nine cases had HS scores of 1 or greater.', u'AD changes, vascular lesions, and atherosclerosis were absent in six cases.', u'Accordingly, nine cases were assigned the pathological diagnosis of AD, six cases had IVD, two cases were mixed AD/IVD/HS/CAA, five cases were cognitively impaired not meeting criteria for AD, and six cases were healthy control subjects (see Table 1).', u'The number of neurons in CA1 was correlated with the number of neurons in CA2 (r = 0.48; p = 0.009) ( Fig 1).', u'The volume of CA1 was correlated with the volume of CA2 (r = 0.59; p = 0.009) (Fig 1).', u'The coefficient of error for these estimates averaged 0.10 \xb1 0.02 for number of neurons in CA1 and 0.12 \xb1 0.04 for number of neurons in CA2.', u'The number of neurons in CA1 was negatively correlated to Braak score (r = \u22120.73;
