Neural Correlates of Dementia: Regional Brain Metabolism (FDG-PET) and the CERAD Neuropsychological Battery
The present investigation examined the biological correlates of the cognitive deficits of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementias using the nemopsychological assessment battery of the Consortium to Establish a Registry of Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) and positron emission tomography (PET).
 Resting state cerebral glucose metabolism was measured using the labelled radiotracer [18F] Fluom-2- deoxyglucose (FDG), in a sample of patients with miki to moderate dementia (n = 66).
 Specific and predictable relationships were seen between regional brain metabolism (left and right, frontal, temporal, andparietal lobes) and the neumpsy- chological measures of verbal fluency, constructional praxis, and verbal list
