Relationship between clock drawing test performance and regional cerebral blood flow in Alzheimer’s disease: A single photon emission computed tomography study
 The clock drawing test (CDT) is a useful tool for screening cognitive impairment.
 Previous neuropsychological studies have revealed that CDT performance requires several cognitive functions including semantic memory, visuospatial function and executive function.
 However, the neural substrates involved remain to be elucidated.
 The aim of the present study was to identify the brain regions responsible for CDT performance in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
 Twenty-six patients satisfying the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD underwent the CDT and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), together with a N- isopropyl-p-[ 123 I] iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography measurements of the resting regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF).
 The CDT score correlated significantly with the MMSE score (r = 0.582; P < 0.05).
 Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the MMSE score and the left posterior temporal rCBF were major predictors of CDT score.
 These findings suggest that the CDT score may reflect the severity of dementia, and that it has a close relationship with the left posterior temporal function.
 Our findings provide the first functional neuroimaging evidence for the neural substrates involved in CDT performance.
INTRODUCTION
      
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by various kinds of neuropsychological manifestations.
 Recently, some researchers have investigated the relationship between neuropsychological performance and regional brain function in AD.
 1–4 The clock drawing test (CDT) is widely used to assess the cognitive function of patients with various neurologic 5,6 and psychiatric 7–10 disorders.
 The CDT requires the subjects to draw a clock with the numerical letters and hands indicating a specific time.
 It is a

simple and easy task to administer and many authors reported it as useful in detecting mild cognitive deficits of very early AD, 11 in differentiating some dementias, 5,6,12 and in assessing cognitive declines of AD.
 13 Although the clinical usefulness of the CDT in AD is well documented, 14–17 the neural substrates involved remain unclear.
 There are no functional neuroimaging studies investigating brain regions related to the CDT performance of AD patients.
 In the present study, we investigated the relationship between CDT score and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in order to assess the neural substrates for the CDT performance.
Subjects
        
All subjects performed the CDT and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).
 19 In the CDT, the subjects were presented with a blank sheet of paper and a pencil, and were given the following instructions: ‘I would like you to draw a clock, put in all the numbers, and set the hands for 20 after 8’.
 A predrawn circle was not provided.
 The resulting drawings were scored by two raters who were blind to the clinical data.
 The Rouleau Clock Scoring quantitative scale (RCS) 5 was used for the rating of clock drawings.
 In the RCS, the clock drawings are evaluated using a 10- point scale designed to independently assess the accu- racy of the representation of the clockface (maximum 2 points), the layout of numbers (maximum 4 points) and the position of the hands (maximum 4 points).
 The mean obtained CDT score in elderly normal control subjects was reported to be 8.94 by Rouleau et al. 5
All subjects underwent N-isopropyl-p-[ 123 I] iodoamphetamine (IMP) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).
 The subjects were scanned using a double-head SPECT camera (PRISM 2000XP, Picker International, Cleveland, OH, USA) with a low-energy high-resolution collimator, and then injected with 185 MBq of 123 I-IMP while sitting with their eyes open.
 Acquisition began 20 min after the injection and lasted for 20 min during a 360-degree rotation of the gamma camera in a 128 ¥ 128 matrix.
 The transaxial plane was reconstructed parallel to the orbitomeatal line at 7.8 mm intervals.
 Two slices were used: one including the basal ganglia and thalamus, and the second slice was 31.2 mm above the first.
 A square region of interest (ROI) of 5 ¥ 5 pixels was used to obtain the activity ratios in the transaxial slices, using the occipital region as a reference.
 The measurements were carried out for the following 12 cortical areas ( Fig. 1): superior frontal (superior Regions of interest (ROIs).
 1, Right superior frontal; 2, left superior frontal; 3, right motor cortex; 4, left motor cortex; 5, right parietal; 6, left parietal; 7, right inferior frontal; 8, left inferior frontal; 9, right anterior temporal; 10, left anterior temporal; 11, right posterior temporal; 12, left posterior temporal; 13, right occipital; 14, left occipital.
 medial frontal gyrus; Brodmann (BA) 8–9) (right and left), inferior frontal (inferior frontal gyrus; BA 10–46) (right and left), motor cortex (right and left), anterior temporal (superior temporal gyrus; BA 22) (right and left), posterior temporal (occipitotemporal association cortex; BA 37) (right and left), and parietal (angular gyrus; BA 39) (right and left).
 To deter- mine the activity ratio, the counts per ROI in each cortical area were divided by the mean counts per ROI found in each occipital region.
 All SPECT measurements were carried out by a neuroradiologist who was blind to the diagnosis and clinical data.

The Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was carried out for comparisons between right and left rCBF.
 The Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to evaluate correlations between CDT score and MMSE score.
 Stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the contribution of MMSE subscores to CDT score.
 Stepwise multiple regression analysis was employed to analyze the contribution of rCBF, MMSE score, age, sex and duration of illness to CDT score.
 The sig- nificance level was set at P = 0.05.
 Data were analyzed using SPSS 10.0 J for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Twenty-six participants (mean ± SD, 74.08 ± 6.30 years; five men and 21 women) were recruited from the Center for Diagnosis of Dementia in Kyoto Prefec-  tural University of Medicine.
 All AD patients met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disease and Stroke-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria 18 for probable AD.
 Screening for all participants included a psychiatric interview and medical examination.
 Participants were excluded if they had any significant history of psychiatric or neurological disorder such as stroke or closed head injury, alcohol abuse, or a serious medical condition.
 Informed consent was obtained from all participants or their caregivers.
The MMSE score ranged between 4 and 29 (mean ± SD, 17.96 ± 5.50).
 The CDT score ranged between 0  and 10 (mean ± SD, 5.65 ± 3.68).
 The rCBF data are shown in Table 1.
 The means of rCBF were ranked: motor cortex > anterior temporal > inferior frontal > posterior temporal > superior frontal > parietal.
 There was no significant difference between right and left.
The CDT score was significantly correlated with the MMSE score (r = 0.582; P < 0.05) (Fig. 2).
 The stepwise multiple regression analysis was performed to analyze the contribution of MMSE subscores to CDT score and showed that the predictors of CDT score were the scores of seven series which required the subject to begin with 100, count backward by seven and stop after five subtractions, three step order and construction (Table 2).
The stepwise multiple regression analysis, which was performed to analyze the contribution of rCBF, MMSE score, age, sex and duration of illness to CDT score, showed that the predictors of CDT score were MMSE score and the left posterior temporal rCBF   (Table 3).
 The results indicated the following formu- lae: CDT score = 0.321 (MMSE score) + 13.855 (left posterior temporal rCBF) – 10.920.
 There was no significant relationship between CDT score and the rCBF of other regions.

examine the correlation between the CDT score and other cognitive measures, 5 our results suggest that the CDT score could reflect the severity of dementia.
 Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that among the 11 subtests of MMSE, the seven series, three step order and construction were the predictors of CDT scores.
 The seven series seems to reflect the numerical concept and short-term memory (e.g., keeping track of the direction).
 Auditory comprehen- sion, measured by three step order, seems to reflect the ability to understand the instructions.
 Construction also seems to be necessary for drawing a clock.
In the present study, the CDT score was found to be related with the left posterior temporal rCBF.
 This finding suggests that the CDT performance in AD patients depends on left posterior temporal function, which is consistent with the results of Forstl et al. who reported that CDT performance in AD correlated with postmortem neuron counts in the temporal lobe.
 27 Some studies have suggested that semantic memory contributes to CDT performance.
 5,22 Rouleau et al. compared the command and copy condition of the CDT in patients with AD and Huntington’s disease, and they reported that in the copy condition, patients with AD showed marked improvement in performance, while patients with HD did not.
 5 Based on these findings the authors concluded that poor CDT performance in AD patients was not due to graphic, motor, or even visuospatial difficulties, but the loss of semantic memory evoked by the word ‘clock’.
 Previous studies suggest that the left hemisphere is as- sociated with semantic memory.
 3,28,29 Hirono et al., who investigated the relationship between semantic memory tests and regional cerebral glucose metabo- lism in 57 patients with AD by 18F-fluorodeoxyglu- cose and positron emission tomography, concluded that semantic memory deficits in AD are related to  impaired function of the left inferior temporal gyrus.
 3 Patterson et al. 28 and Grossman et al. 29 also reported that the left temporal region is involved in semantic memory.
 Although semantic memory was not exam- ined in the present study, our results which show that CDT performance in AD depends on the left temporal function suggest that RCS may also reflect semantic memory.
 We did not find any significant relationship between the CDT score and the rCBF of the frontal and parietal regions.
 This finding may derive from the scoring systems of RCS, which mainly reflects semantic memory and may not be sensitive to executive and visuospatial dysfunction.
 In other scoring systems for the CDT, CLOX is reported to reflect executive function, 23 while the Clock Drawing Interpretation Scale is reported to reflect visuospatial function.
 20 Further neuroimaging studies employing various different scoring systems for the CDT are necessary to evaluate the relationship between CDT performance and cognitive function of frontal and parietal lobes.

This study suggests that the CDT performance in AD is mediated by left posterior temporal function.
 The present study provides the first functional neuroimaging evidence for the neural substrates of the CDT performance in AD.
