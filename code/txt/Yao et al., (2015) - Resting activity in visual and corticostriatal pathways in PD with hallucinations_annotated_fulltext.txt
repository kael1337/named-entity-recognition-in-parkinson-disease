Resting activity in visual and corticostriatal pathways in Parkinson's disease with hallucinations
Background: Visual hallucinations are an important non-motor complication of Parkinson's disease (PD) and carry a negative prognosis.
 Their biological basis is uncertain, but may relate to the activity of resting state networks in brain.
 We therefore aimed to investigate functional activity of brain in patients with visual hallucinations (PDVH) in resting state compared to patients without hallucinations (PDnonVH) and a healthy control group (HC).
 Methods: Resting state functional MRI was acquired and the primary analysis compared the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) across groups.
 This informed a secondary analysis, in the PD groups only, comparing functional connectivity between a ‘seed’ region in the occipital lobe and the rest of the brain.
 Results: Individuals with PDVH showed lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus and greater ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, medial temporal gyrus and cerebellum than PDnonVH and HC.
 PDnonVH also had lower ALFF in occipitoparietal region and greater ALFF in medial temporal gyrus, temporo- parietal and cerebellum regions than HC.
 Functional connectivity analysis revealed that, although both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity relative to the HC group, occipital e corticostriatal connectivity was significantly higher in those with PDVH compared with PDnonVH.
 Conclusion: Our study reveals widespread hemodynamic alterations in PD.
 However, within a func- tionally abnormal occipital lobe, those with PDVH have even lower ALFF than non-hallucinators, but have higher occipital functional connectivity with cortical-striatal regions.
 These findings suggest disruption of pathways underpinning both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic visual integration may contribute to visual hallucinations in PD. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Parkinson's Disease (PD) is classically regarded as a motor disorder, but non-motor manifestations also occur [ 1].
 One of the most common and striking features is visual hallucinations [2].
 Visual hallucinations affect 20e75% of patients with PD, and predict de- mentia and mortality [3].
 The underlying biology of visual hallucinations in PD remains poorly understood but is thought to involve functional abnormalities in primary visual cortex along with altered activity in visual associative cortices [4].
 Altered task- dependent hemodynamic activity has also been observed in frontal and subcortical regions in individuals with PD and visual hallucinations (PDVH) [5, 6], suggesting that top-down regulatory processes may contribute [7].
 However, the direction of findings reported in functional studies has not always been consistent.
 This is likely to be at least partly due to the distinct demands of different task designs, therefore an investigation of baseline function is of potential clinical value.
 We previously examined activity within the default mode network in PDVH.
 We found that PDVH had greater coactivation within this network compared to PD patients without visual hallucinations (PDnonVH) [8].
 We also reported disrupted functional connectivity between frontal regions and the hippocampus in PDVH [9].
 We interpreted these findings as supporting the hypothesis of interrupted top-down processing in PDVH [7].
 However, we did not examine whole brain functional activity in PDVH.
 Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) has been developed by Zang et al. [10] to measure whole-brain resting-state (rs)-fMRI.
 ALFF has been linked to neuronal glucose metabolism [11] and correlates with local field potential activity [12].
 Alter- ations in ALFF have described in a number of disorders including schizophrenia and major depressive disorder [13, 14], making the patterns of ALFF alterations potentially useful biomarkers for complex neuropsychiatric conditions.
 In this study, we first compared resting whole brain activity in individuals with PD with and without visual hallucinations and an unaffected elderly control (HC) group.
 We then examined resting state functional connectivity between a ‘seed’ region, defined by result of the ALFF analysis, and the rest of the brain.
 We hypothesized that the PDVH would have altered ALFF in visual cortices reflecting a deficit in visual processing.
 In addition, we predicted that there would be functional connectivity abnormalities between primary visual cortex and ‘higher-order’ brain regions in PDVH.

 Materials and methods 2.1.
 Participants Eligible patients were referred by the Movement Disorders Clinic by the attending neurologist, whilst HC were recruited from the patient's social network or the local community by advertisement.
 Parkinson's disease was diagnosed accord- ing to the criteria of the UK Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank.
 The assessments included the following: Hoehn and Yahr Scale [15] to assess stage of illness; Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS; Fahn et al., 1987), part III to evaluate motor symptom severity; MontgomeryeÅsberg Depression Rating Scale e Self-assessment (MADRS-S) [16] to rate depressive symptoms; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) [17] to assess cognitive impairment; and the Parkinson Psychosis Rating Scale (PPRS) [18] to assess psychosis.
 The PPRS includes a detailed description of visual hallucinations recorded from patients and caregivers.
 Patients were recruited who experienced repetitive and complex visual hallucinations usually reporting seeing these as well-formed persons, animals or objects, lasting for at least 4 weeks and occurring at least once every 4 weeks.
 Exclusion criteria were: neurological disorders other than Parkinson's disease; other psychiatric disorders; mild to moderate depressive symptoms (MADRS >6); severe cognitive impairment if the MMSE <24.
 All participants were right handed.
 A levodopa equivalent dose (levodopa and dopaminergic agonists) was calculated as described in the literature [19].
 All participants were reimbursed for travel expenses and signed informed consent for participation.
 The study was ethically approved by the local Institutional Review Board.
 Demographic and clinical characteristics are described in Table 1.
 2.2.
 MRI data acquisition Resting functional MRI data were acquired by a 3T scanner (Achieva; Philips Healthcare, Hong Kong) using the 8-channel phased-array head coil with patients in the supine position.
 The functional imaging data were acquired using a gradient- echo echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequence sensitive to BOLD contrast.
 Acquisition parameters were: TR 1⁄4 1800 ms; TE 1⁄4 30 ms; flip angle 1⁄4 90 ; 220 volumes; 45 axial slices; anterior-posterior acquisition; in-plane resolution 1⁄4 3.75 Â 3.75 mm; slice thickness 1⁄4 4 mm; field of view 1⁄4 240 Â 180 Â 240 mm; acquisition time 1⁄4 6.6 min.
 Slice acquisition order was contiguous.
 Earplugs were used to reduce scanner noise and head motion was restricted by a foam pillow as well as extendable padded head clamps.
 Participants were asked to simply rest in the scanner with their eyes closed before each resting state scan and not fall asleep while remaining as still as possible.

 Three-dimensional T1-weighted anatomical MRI were also acquired with fast field echo sequence (Magnetization Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo, MPRAGE), with the parameters: TR 1⁄4 6895 ms; TE 1⁄4 3.16 ms; FA 1⁄4 8 ; 1 Â 1 Â 1 mm voxels; FOV 1⁄4 250 Â 250 Â 155 mm; number of slices 1⁄4 155.
 2.3.
 Functional imaging analysis 2.3.1.
 Image preprocessing of resting fMRI Preprocessing was performed using SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). First, all functional images were corrected for slice timing and head movement.
 Functional scans with excessive head movement >2.5 mm of displacement or >2.5 of rotation in any direction were discarded.
 Prior to band-pass filtering (0.01e0.08 Hz), the following nuisance covariates were regressed from the BOLD signal: six rigidebody parameters; white matter signal; cerebrospinal fluid signal.
 After generation of ALFF and functional connectivity, all functional data were normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space by applying the transformation parameters obtained from the structural images (see the following “structural image analysis” section for details) to those time and motion corrected and nuisance covaried images, resampled (3 Â 3 Â 3 voxels) and smoothed (4-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel).
 2.4.
 ALFF calculations At each voxel the BOLD time series was first converted to the frequency domain using a Fast Fourier Transform and the square root of the power spectrum was computed and then averaged across a specified frequency range (0.01e0.08 Hz) to remove residual low and high frequency noise in resting state.
 Once transformed by Fisher's Z to reduce the global effects of variability across participants, this value is referred to as the ALFF for a given voxel [10].
 Calculations were made using REST software version 1.8 (www.restfmri.net) [20].
 2.5.
 Functional connectivity of the occipital seed Functional connectivity was based on a seed-region approach and conducted in MNI space.
 The area in occipital lobe with a significantly lower ALFF signal in the PDVH compared to PDnonVH was selected as the seed region.
 For all participants, mean occipital time series extracted from the seed region were correlated with the time series at all other brain voxels using Pearson's coefficient of correlation fol- lowed by Fisher's r-to-z transformation.
 2.6.
 Structural image analysis Individual structural T1-weighted images were co-registered to the mean motion-corrected functional images using a linear transformation.
 They were then segmented into gray matter, white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in MNI space by using “New Segment” in SPM8.
 DARTEL [21] was then used to create a study-specific template.
 GM, WM and CSF were then normalized to MNI space and smoothed with an 8-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel.
 Mean modulated and smoothed GM maps (intensity threshold 1⁄4 0.2) were used to generate a group GM mask and
applied as a mask for analyzing ALFF differences in the comparisons, specific to the groups involved in a particular test.
 2.7.
 Statistical analysis Between-group voxel-wise comparisons were performed using two sample t- test.
 The ALFF and functional connectivity comparisons were restricted within the corresponding GM mask generated as described above.
 All the statistical tests were corrected for multiple comparisons to a significance level of p < 0.05 using Monte Carlo simulations (uncorrected single voxel significance level of p < 0.05 and a minimum cluster size based on the size of the gray matter mask of each load) [22].
 Independent two sample t-tests were used to compare demographic factors between groups, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 15.0.1) (SPSS for Windows, 2006), a chi-squared test was used to compare gender and affected body side among groups.
 The relationship between levodopa-equivalent dosage and ALFF/functional connectivity results in PDVH group was assessed with Pearson correlation analysis.
 A similar analysis between PD severity (UPDRS-III score)/MMSE scores and ALFF/functional connectivity results in the PD group was also undertaken.
Thirty-eight (38) individuals had useable data; 24 were patients with Parkinson's Disease idiopathic type (comprising 12 with visual hallucinations and 12 without) and 14 unaffected healthy controls.
 The characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1.
 All participants were matched for age (>50 years), gender and MMSE score.
 PD participants were matched for duration of PD illness, motor symptom severity, PD stage, levodopa-equivalent dosage.
 All were described as in the “on” state during the assessment.
 In the group of PDVHs, four reported having visual hallucinations about 1e3 times per month, five had hallucinations 1e2 times per week, and three reported having hallucinations every day.
 Nine participants experienced hallucinations of people, 1 participant of animals and objects, 1 of only objects, and 1 experienced ‘presence of a person’ hallucinations.
 Two patients reported visual illusions in addition to visual hallucinations.
 Three patients with visual hallucinations were on antipsychotic medication.
 The visual hallucinations were benign in all patients, with insight intact.
 Participants were asked if they experienced hallucinations in the scanner e none were reported.
 Moreover, participants were asked not to fall asleep during scan at the beginning of scan and in the middle of each scan session.

 PDVH participants had lower ALFF in bilateral lingual gyrus and cuneus than PD non-hallucinators.
 This joint occipital seed region was used for analysis of functional connectivity, please see panel A of Fig. 2.
 Higher ALFF was observed in medial temporal lobe (including parahippocampus and hippocampus) and fusiform gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and superior temporal gyrus (temporo- parietal gyrus), and right cerebellum in PDVH group compared to PDnonVH.
 When depression scores were introduced as covariates, the difference between PD groups remained.
 There was no significant correlation between levodopa-equivalent dosage and ALFF results in PDVH group, and no significant correlation between PD severity/cognitive ability and ALFF results in PD patients.
 Compared to HC, the PDVH group had lower ALFF in cuneus, lingual gyrus and superior/middle frontal gyrus, and greater ALFF in medial and inferior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and cerebellum.
 PDnonVH group had a similar pattern of differences compared to HC; namely, lower ALFF in cunues and precuneus, and greater ALFF in medial temporal lobe, temporo-parietal lobe and cerebellum.
 Functional connectivity results of between-group comparisons are displayed in Table 2.
 The comparison between PDnonVH and PDVH is shown in Fig. 2.
 The group comparison between HC and the two PD groups (PDVH and PDnonVH) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 2.
 Both PD groups had lower occipital functional connectivity with widespread brain regions compared to HCs.
 However, within the PD groups, occipital functional connectivity with inferior/superior/ middle and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, superior temporal gyrus, caudate, thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) was greater in PDVH compared to the PDnonVH group.
 No instances of lower functional connectivity were observed in PDVH participants compared to PDnonVH.
 There was no significant correlation between levodopa-equivalent dosage and functional connectivity results in the PDVH group (see supplementary table), and no significant correlation between PD severity and functional connectivity in the PD group.

3.3.
 Functional connectivity
The current study showed that PDVH had lower ALFF (or intrinsic resting-state brain activity fluctuation) in the primary visual cortex and higher ALFF in visual associative cortices and cerebellum, relative to both PDnonVH and HC.
 PDnonVH also had less ALFF in primary visual cortex and superior parietal cortex compared to HCs.
 In a subsidiary investigation of functional connectivity between occipital region and other brain areas, PDVH showed greater occipital functional connectivity in bilateral frontal cortex and right superior temporal gyrus, caudate and thalamus, and right dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) compared to PDnonVH.
The results support our hypothesis that there is abnormal resting activity in visual cortices in PDVH.
 The results are consistent with the prevailing literature in Parkinson's disease with visual hallucinations, which has reported functional abnormalities in primary visual cortex [23].
 The functional deficit observed in occipital cortex here may be a consequence of intrinsic visual cortical pathology, and is consistent with reports of other visual processing anomalies in PDVH such as double vision [24] and disturbance of visual accuracy [25].
Visual associative cortices such as temporo-parietal cortices and medial temporal gyrus had greater hemodynamic fluctuation in PDVH compared to PDnonVH.
 The dual stream hypothesis of visual  processing [26] places the parietal regions in the dorsal visual pathway, whereas the temporal regions belong to the ventral visual pathway.
 Both pathways originate in occipital regions then project through inferior parietal and inferior temporal gyri respectively to the perirhinal-hippocampal cortices.
 Dual pathway disruption has been postulated to underlie visual hallucinations in Parkinson's Disease [27], and our result of higher ALFF in temporo-parietal and hippocampal regions might support this notion.
 In contrast to our result of higher ALFF in temporo-parietal regions, Boecker et al., 2007 reported reduced regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose consumption in visual associative cortices in PDVH [28].
 The discrepant directions of effect reported in our two studies may be due to differences in the sample characteristics - our participants with visual hallucinations were relatively less impaired.
 Alternatively, the indices used may have different physiological bases that ALFF reflects neuronal energy consumption [11].
 Our observation of high ALFF in visual associative cortex is also at variance with reports of lower task-dependent functional activity in these regions in PDVH [4].
 We speculate that higher ALFF in visual associative cortices implies greater neuronal energy consumption at rest [11] possibly leaving limited ‘reserve’ for the demands of a task-dependent design.
 This aberrant resting state activation in PDVH may constitute the physiological signature of inappropriate intrinsic visual memory processes as proposed by the ‘disinhibition hypothesis’ of PDVH [27].
 The occipital region (cuneus and lingual gyrus) which had lower ALFF in PDVH compared to PDnonVH was used as seed region of interest to investigate functional connectivity across the entire brain (see Fig. 2).
 Compared with PDnonVH, PDVH showed increased occipital functional connectivity with the prefrontal gyrus, dACC, superior temporal gyrus and midbrain including caudate and thalamus.
 This is in line with our previous findings of ‘top-down’ anomalies in this cohort, namely greater functional connectivity within the default mode network (including prefrontal cortex) [8] and greater functional connectivity between hippocampus and bilateral frontal cortex [9] in PDVH compared to PDnonVH.
 Our observation of pathology within this cortico-striato- thalamic circuitry is also a feature of other psychotic conditions [29].
 Thus, in psychosis, altered functional activity in this network may disrupt the cognitive control to overcome distractions or competing responses [29].
 Specifically in PDVH, greater occipital- corticostriatal connectivity could signal a failure to regulate visual processing, including filtering distracting information.
 Placed together, lower ALFF in the occipital cortex, higher ALFF in visual associative cortices and altered functional connectivity with cortico-striatal systems in PDVH, fits well with the theory that visual hallucinations result from limited “bottom-up” peripheral sensory input from primary visual cortex and unconstrained “top- down” processing of endogenous images and attentional cognitive control from frontal regions.
 ALFF was greater in cerebellum in the PDVH compared to the PDnonVH.
 Hemodynamic change in cerebellum has been little investigated in PDVH, possibly because of task design or scan coverage.
 Increasingly, studies have substantiated the view that the human cerebellum not only subserves motor control but also supports cognitive processes including visual processing [30].
 It is also thought that the cerebellum helps predict visual perceptual events through a cerebrocerebellar loop consisting of posterior parietal cortex, V5 and the cerebellum in a top-down processing network [30].
 Therefore, the altered cerebellar hemodynamic oscillation in PDVH might imply cerebellar recruitment perhaps in compensation for higher-order cortical anomalies.
 We acknowledge our study has limitations.
 One is our relatively modest sample size.
 However, given the practical difficulty in recruiting and scanning this population, our numbers compare favorably to the existing literature; also, our results survived multiple comparison correction, which reduces the risk of false-positive results.
 Another limitation is that the PD patients recruited in our study were scanned in the “on” medication state to facilitate scanning.
 In the “off” state scanning would be challenging given the likelihood of movement which leads to decreased signal-to noise ratio, discomfort, and abortive scanning.
 Although it could be argued that dopaminergic medication differences contribute to visual hallucinations, the levodopa-equivalent dosage is balanced in our study, and our study showed no correlation between levodopa-equivalent dosage and ALFF/functional connectivity results in PDVH.
 Moreover, 3 patients with hallucinations also received antipsychotic medication, and while it is possible that our results could potentially be influenced by this treatment, if anything this should minimize the relationship between hallucination severities and altered functional activity.
 Finally, we acknowledge that although we reminded participants not to sleep before and during the scan session, it is still possible that PD patients fell asleep through fatigue, despite prompts [1].
 However, the PDnonVH group could just as easily have fallen asleep as PDVH, making sleep unlikely to explain the findings specific to PDVH.

 Limitations
Our study suggests that visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with disrupted hemodynamic activity at rest in primary visual cortex.
 However, we also observed greater ALFF in the visual associative cortices and right cerebellum, together with greater functional connectivity between primary visual cortex and frontal, temporal and midbrain regions in the PDVH.
 Taken together, these findings indicate that both primary visual perceptual and intrinsic integration deficits may collectively contribute to visual hallucinations in PD.
