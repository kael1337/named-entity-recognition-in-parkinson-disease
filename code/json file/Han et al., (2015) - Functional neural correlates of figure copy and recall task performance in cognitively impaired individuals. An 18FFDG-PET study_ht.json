", "PET data ", "The CERAD CP and CR tests consisted of four visual stimuli (circle, diamond, overlapping rectangles, and cube), with increasing complexity. First, participants were required to copy each item exposed (CP). Approximately 5 min after completing the CP test, par- ticipants were asked to recall and draw the CP items from memory (CR). The scoring range was 0\u201311 for both the CP and CR tests. "]}
