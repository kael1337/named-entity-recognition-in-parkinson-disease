Painful sensations are highly variable in PD but, according to a pathophysiological approach, two main different types of pain can be distinguished: nociceptive pain mainly related to motor symptoms (dystonias, cramps, painful dyskinesias, etc.) caused by pathological activation of nociceptors (with intact somatosensory pathways) and neuropathic pain (classically described as burning, tingling, etc.), related to central pain processing dysfunction ", "In this prospective study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of STN-DBS on pain perception in PD patients, using a valid and reliable questionnaire [5], the short McGill Pain Questionnaire Pain Questionnaire of Saint Antoine (MPQ-QDSA) e which allows a multidimensional, qualitative and quantitative pain assessment. Moreover, we investigated correlations between pain and motor status, depression and dopaminergic treatment changes after STN-DBS.
