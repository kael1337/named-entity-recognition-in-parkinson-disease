{"1": ["degenerative disease characterised by both motor and non-motor symptoms, such as apathy ", "Apathy is a disabling non-motor symptom that is frequently observed in Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD). Its description and physiopathology suggest that it is partially mediated by emotional impairment, but this research issue has never been addressed at a clinical and metabolic level. We therefore conducted a metabolic 18\ufb02uorodeoxyglucose study using positron emission 18FDG tomography ( PET) in 36 PD patients without depression and dementia. Apathy was assessed on the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), and emotional facial recognition (EFR) performances (ie, percentage of correct responses) were calculated for each patient. Confounding factors such as age, antiparkinsonian and antidepressant medication, global cognitive functions and depressive symptoms were controlled fo ", "emotional facial recognition (EFR) "], "3": ["We found a correlation between increased metabolism within the left posterior cingulate gyrus (BA 31; z score=3.02, cluster size=83 voxels) and higher AES scores ", "impaired EFR scores (ie, low scores on the EFR task) were positively correlated with metabolism (ie, decreased metab- olism) within the precuneus and the inferior occipital gyrus.
