The temporal distribution of atrophy and correlation for nam- ing in FTD overlaps in part with that seen in AD in ante- rior portions of the left temporal lobe. However, the nam- ing\u2013atrophy correlation also was more robust in the right anterior temporal cortex in FTD compared with AD. We also found that the correlation for naming extends into the bilateral frontal regions in FTD.  "]}
