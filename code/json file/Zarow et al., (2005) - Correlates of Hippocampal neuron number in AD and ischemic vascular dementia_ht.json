{"2": ["The cornu ammonis 1 region of the hippocampus (CA1) sector of hippocampus is vulnerable ", " an optimized design was implemented for sampling, measuring volume, measuring the size, and estimating the number of neurons in CA1 and CA2 subfields of the hippocampus using the optical dissector for cases with the pathological diagnosis of AD or IVD and normal control subjects. ", "global cognitive ability ", "memory  ", "executive (Executive) function ", "emory was derived from delayed and cued recall and selected immediate recall trials of the word list learning task of the Memory Assessment Scales ", "Global included: (1) total recall on trials 1 and 2 of the Memory Assessment Scales word list learning task;  ", "digit span forward and Revised7; backward from the Wechsler Memory Scale- (3) letter fluency (the letter A from the test8; 8 FAS and (4) Animal category fluency. ", "Executive scale used letter fluency (F, A, and S), digit span backward, visual span backward, and the Initiation-Perseveration subscale of the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale as donor scales. ", "performed for 20 cases in this study "], "5": ["Neuropsychological examinations were administered to 20 subjects ", "Global and Memory scores, as well as Demential Rating Scale score, correlated with the number of neurons in CA1 ", "Hippocampal volume from the MRI was significantly related to the Memory and the Demential Rating Scale scores but not the Executive score.
