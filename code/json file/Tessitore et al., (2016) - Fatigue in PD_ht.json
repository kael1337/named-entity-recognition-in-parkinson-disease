To our knowledge, no previous MRI reports have investigated functional or structural correlates of fatigue in PD. We hypothe- size that a disrupted connectivity within motor- and cognitive-related networks may underlie this disabling nonmotor symptom in the early stage of the disease. In addition, we used voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to assess whether potential connectivity changes were dependent on structural brain differences.
