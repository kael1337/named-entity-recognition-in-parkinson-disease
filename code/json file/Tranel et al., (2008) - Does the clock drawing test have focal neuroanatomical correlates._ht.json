The map shows that subjects who were impaired were clustered in two groups: (1) Subjects with lesions overlapping in the right hemisphere, with foci in the right parietal cortices (mostly in the supramarginal gyrus), the middle and superior temporal cortices, the frontal operculum, and the insula and underlying subcortical structures (including anterior basal ganglia); and (2) Subjects with lesions overlapping in the left inferior frontal-parietal opercular cortices, with foci in the inferior frontal gyrus, the lower sector of the precentral and postcentral gyri, the anterior sector of the supramarginal gyrus, and the insula and underlying basal ganglia.
