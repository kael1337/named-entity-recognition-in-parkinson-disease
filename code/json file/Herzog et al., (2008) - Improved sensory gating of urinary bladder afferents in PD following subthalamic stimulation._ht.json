These deficits are thought to result from deficient gating of sensory information due to basal ganglia dysfunction in PD. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) has been shown to improve sensory deficits in PD, e.g. STN-DBS normalizes the perception of urinary bladder filling in patients with PD. This study aimed at investigating how STN-DBS modulates the processing of urinary bladder information to elucidate the (patho-)physiology of sensory gating mechanisms in PD.
